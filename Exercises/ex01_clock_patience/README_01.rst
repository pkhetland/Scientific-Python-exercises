INF200 Exercise 01:
=================

Petter Hetland:
-------------------

This folder contains the assignments for EX_01 for the INF200-class.

The main file is "ex_01_sim", which is updated and based on best-practice
guidelines given by Yngve.

"ex_01_play" and "ex_01_play_func" are script meant to allow the user to
play the game interactively, and are based on my attempts to solve
the problem prior to being given the solution in L02.

The four different tasks are the introduction tasks for ex_01_sim.
